// workaround from https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/426#issuecomment-658901422
// We set an intercept on incoming requests to disable x-frame-options
// headers.

// Should we do this? Does this make evil sites doing danagerous things?

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Plugin frames, the lsp:// scheme, and CORS
//
// Plugin frames are served over the privileged lsp:// scheme, which is a real
// origin, so Chromium enforces CORS on the requests they make. Most endpoints a
// plugin talks to either send no Access-Control-Allow-Origin at all (ordinary web
// pages, local APIs such as Zotero or Syncthing) or omit the plugin's custom client
// header from Access-Control-Allow-Headers, so the request fails before it is sent.
// The previous file:// renderer had no CORS applied and the same calls worked.
//
// Why this is not a new capability: any plugin can already perform unrestricted
// HTTP through logseq.Request -> exper_request -> node-fetch in the main process,
// with arbitrary URLs and headers and no CORS at all. Against a hostile plugin,
// browser CORS is not a boundary here; it only penalises honest plugins using
// plain fetch.
//
// The one thing browser CORS still buys us is protection of *ambient* credentials:
// a main-process request carries no browser cookies, a credentialed fetch does. So
// we publish a WILDCARD origin rather than echoing the request origin -- the browser
// rejects "*" outright for credentialed requests, which keeps cookie-bearing
// cross-origin reads blocked while ordinary plugin requests succeed. Do not change
// this to echo the origin: combined with a server sending
// Access-Control-Allow-Credentials, that would let a plugin read another site's
// authenticated responses, which IS an escalation over what it can do today.
//
// Unlike webSecurity:false this leaves the same-origin policy for DOM access and
// mixed-content blocking untouched.
//
// IMPORTANT, and easy to get wrong when testing this: the SDK installs a fetch
// bridge in every plugin frame that routes http(s) `fetch` to the main process. A
// bridged request never reaches Chromium's CORS layer at all, so the headers below
// apply only to UNBRIDGED requests from plugin frames -- XHR, and anything issued
// before the bridge installs.
//
// NOTE: this must stay inside the single onHeadersReceived listener below --
// Electron allows only ONE listener per method per session, so a second
// registration elsewhere silently replaces this one.

// External plugin roots
//
// Plugins installed outside the dot-root are served from
// lsp://logseq.com/external/<urlencoded-root>/..., i.e. the URL names the
// directory to serve from. resolveWithin can only verify that the file stays
// inside the root it was given; it cannot know whether that root is legitimate.
// Without an allowlist, a URL naming any directory on disk would be served
// through the privileged lsp:// scheme.
//
// Roots are seeded once at startup from the SDK's own record of installed
// external plugins (preferences.json "externals"), which is the right source of
// truth for "which roots may be served from".
